You can override several default settings with the .ciadfrc file in your $HOME
$HOME/.ciadfrc:
func <string>     give a functional. Detection of functional type may not always succeed...
vdw on/off        if "vdw" and "on" found you will use DFT-D
cosmo <string>    set <string> as default solvent, you still have to use '-cosmo'
grid <real>       enter numerical intergration grid. (x.x)
basis <string>    enter the basis set
trustrad <real>   enter trust radius for geometry optimization (x.xx), default is 0.3
maxcycle <int>    maxcycle in GeoOpt
scfiter <int>     max of SCF iterations
notc              turns of $TC_SUBMISSION_DIR
smear             turns on el-smearing (the ADF default !) 
tenergy           turns on TOTALENERGY calculation
format xyz/tmol   xyz or turbomole, default is xyz
ifile <string>   input file
restart off      if found, no restart comments are written to the input
more special options:
(ofile <sting>    output file for job (JOB option))
(ADFPREP         if found, it prepares a convenient minimal jobscript, ready to submit (JOB option))


Help:
ciadf -h
ciadf -v  prints default (based on .ciadfrc, if found)

infile: input coordinates, either XYZ or TMOL(turbomole) format, XYZ without first 2 lines is also accepted
jobfile: name/description of the calculation(also TITEL in adf input). submit this if Job option is NOT given 

(outfile: input for ADF if job option is given) 

Output of the calculation:
"jobfile.out": normal adf output
"jobfile.t21": TAPE21

you have to use escape characters "\" if you want to enter something with brackets!
instead "-sym C(S)" enter "-sym C\(S\)"

default "jobfile" is "job.<PID>" 

Fragments:
-frag <file>  with one Fragment identifier per line:
 eg.  frag.dat:
            MyFrag1
            MyFrag2

examples:
PBE-D/DZP calculation with large Grid and tight criteria for gradient and scf and small frozen core.
ciadf -vdw -func pbe -bas DZP -grid 7 -grad 4 -scfconv 7 -fc small -noopt -f some.xyz -n C60_singelpoint

transition state search with default settings, follow mode 3
ciadft -ts 3 -f ts.in -n TS_opt



since the cluster+adf doesnt provide easy to use restart options for unfinished jobs:
with '-wall <int>' you can give the walltime you want to use for your jobs.
If you use the JOB options then 1 min before the walltime is reached, TAPE21 and TAPE13 are copied
back to the network drive. 
eg: ciadf -f H2opt -o H2opt_job -job -wall 20     
the H2opt_job must then be submitted. It makes sure that 1min before the walltime (20h) is reached, your restart files
are savely copied back to your submission dir.
